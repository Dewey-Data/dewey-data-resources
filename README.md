## What is Dewey?
[Dewey](https://www.deweydata.io/) is a research data platform built exclusively for accessing valuable data for academic research. Our database includes products on corporate finance, real estate, public policy, workforce management, marketing, urban planning, GIS, behavioral economics, weather, and much more. We manage all communications and licensing directly with our data partners, giving them a single, straightforward outlet for reaching the academic market. Because of our model for working with vendors, Dewey is typically the only, and the most affordable, way to access data from these companies for academic research purposes.

### Simlarweb

- [This CoLab notebook](https://www.deweydata.io/) shows you how to download data using the `deweydatapy` library. We then join a domain key to the dataset to improve the legibility of our visuals. Next, we will preform some high-level analysis of the most downloaded Android apps. Finally, we will review user habits of social media apps on Android. </li>
